    Alhaitham is a member of the Haravatat of the Sumeru Akademiya and the Akademiya's Scribe, 
    responsible for documenting their findings and drafting ordinances. The current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya. 
    This title may sound very impressive, but it's really because the Akademiya has a culture of using official titles 
    to inflate one's ego. Alhaitham capable person who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. 
    Alhaitham himself is a powerful rebuttal to all these clich√© views: He is a brilliant man, but he is only an ordinary employee of the Akademiya, 
    with a stable job and a cushy house in Sumeru, leading a carefree and comfortable life.
    Sometimes, people find it next to impossible to catch the current scribe in his office. Little do they know about the scribe, other than his name, "Alhaitham," and that he is supposed to be present during work hours. The fact is, no one knows his whereabouts, and all they can do is leave documents and files on his desk.
    Alhaitham couldn't be more satisfied with how things are. The man might be at home or in the library, but he'll never appear where people wish him to be.
    Having an entirely unpredictable schedule affords undisturbed freedom.
