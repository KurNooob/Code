        Xiao (Chinese: 魈 Xiāo) is a playable Anemo character in Genshin Impact. <br>
        <br>
        He is an adeptus, under the name Alatus, and the sole surviving member of the five foremost Yakshas 
        dispatched by Morax <br> 
        to subdue the demonic spirits that plagued Liyue. 
        He currently resides at Wangshu Inn and mostly restrains himself from large crowds and social interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the mighty and illuminated adepti guarding Liyue, also heralded as the "Vigilant Yaksha." <br>
        Despite his youthful appearance, tales of his exploits have been documented for millennia. <br>
        He is especially fond of Wangshu Inn's Almond Tofu. <br>
        This is because it tastes just like the sweet dreams he used to devour.
